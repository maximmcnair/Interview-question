# Task

I need to be able to create a motorbike, allowing me to pass the colour of the motorbike as a parameter. If I do not specify a colour, it should default to black.

The motorbike should have a honk method, which sets its honking property to true immediately, and sets its honking property to false after 1 second.

The motorbike should have a run method, which sets its running property to true.

I will be creating many thousands of these rapidly, so I need it to be as efficient as possible for memory usage and speed of creation.
